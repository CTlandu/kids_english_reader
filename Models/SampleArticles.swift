            Once there was a tiny caterpillar named Max who lived in a magnificent garden. Every day, he would munch on fresh leaves and observe the beautiful butterflies soaring through the air. Max was curious about what it felt like to fly.
            
            One day, he began to build a chrysalis around himself. Inside, a miraculous transformation took place. When he emerged, Max had become a spectacular butterfly with vibrant wings!
